The Tokardy tech team appreciates and values the following points for (future-) Tokars:

## 1. Production / method

Being agile, which means:
- work on what brings the most value to Toucan at the moment t
  <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    To find out, I ask myself the following questions:
    - will what I am doing benefit a user/customer/designer/tokar from the moment it is launched? If so, will it allow him to do something he couldn't do before? Will it allow him to do something twice as fast as before?
    - on the other hand, is what I have done a marginal improvement, or one that does not benefit anyone in the immediate future?
    - is what I'm working on merged/integrated into the product? Or is it dropped?
  </details>
- set very progressive steps and stick to them
  <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    - my feature has been divided, every bit of the feature is written in the Trello card, it is unique and each step is short
    - my feature was not divided, I quickly saw that it was more complicated than expected, I put the Trello card back into cut-out
  </details>
- deliver these small steps as often as possible
  <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    - I can make a v0 of my functionality and present it in a few days
    - I can start a project with confidence that PR will be offered in the evening
    - I focus on the essentials in the PRs and avoid making additional modifications "by the way".
  </details>
- communicate your goal and progress to the rest of the team
  <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    - I communicate via daily on my current projects, my difficulties
    - I update Trello, the wiki
    - my PRs are clear and self-sufficient (screenshots, test urls, examples of API use, examples of confs)
    - I can retrospectively say the projects and tasks on which I have participated
  </details>

## 2. Autonomy

Being autonomous means that when you take a subject, you commit yourself to it and put the necessary energy into it to get to the point of rendering it.
This does not mean **NOT** working alone.

In particular, we recommend:
- to precisely identify the need to which we are responding: what is the demo of my feature?
- to identify precisely the points on which assistance is needed
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>

    - I know how to do my self-criticism when a task does not progress and I know how to communicate it
  </details>
- to go to his colleagues with specific and clear questions
- to take the tasks at the top of the common backlogs that I can take and commit to process

## 3. Apprenticeship

To be a volunteer and a driving force in your learning, and to participate in the learning of your colleagues, is:
- take the time to peer-program as often as possible
  <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    - Communicate well with the rest of the team to synchronize with your teammate by setting events in the calendar
  </details>
- document during the learning process for the following
- follow his learning (thanks to a board for example) and communicate it to the rest of the team, then take the lead on newly acquired subjects to validate them

## 4. Attitude

Have a good work ethic, be honest with yourself and your colleagues about:
- its skills
- its difficulties (which will be used to solve them)
- its ability to deliver (there is no point in announcing the moon, if not to disappoint)
