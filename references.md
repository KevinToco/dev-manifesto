  Software projects are a popular way of funding and organizing software development. They organize work into 
  temporary, build-only teams and are funded with specific benefits projected in a business case. Product-mode 
  instead uses durable, ideate-build-run teams working on a persistent business issue. Product-mode allows teams 
  to reorient quickly, reduces their end-to-end cycle time, and allows validation of actual benefits by using 
  short-cycle iterations while maintaining the architectural integrity of their software to preserve their 
  long-term effectiveness.

  and 1 on 1, but figured it was time to write something up so we can share it at large.
